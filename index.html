<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>
    I joined the "interactive fiction" community some time in the 1990's. This
    community was based in two different <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroups:
    <code>rec.arts.int-fiction</code> and <code>rec.games.int-fiction</code>,
    the former ostensibly for discussing the creation of games, and the latter
    ostensibly for the disucssion of the playing of games. In reality, there
    was not much difference between the two as there was virtually 100%
    overlap between the denizens.
</p><p>
    When a game was released, sometimes there was discussion about its puzzles
    (mostly asking for help), and sometimes even its merits as a game were
    disected. About halfway through the 1990's, the idea of an annual <a
    href="https://ifcomp.org/history/">competition</a> formed, and this
    resulted in many more games, which spawned many more discussions.
</p><p>
    One of the results of the competition, besides having more games to play,
    was having lots of reviews to read. This was great especially for the game
    authors - seeing feedback is always welcome after having put time and
    energy into creating something. The downside was that much of the energy
    of the community was directed at the competition and its games, which left
    non-competition games starved for reviews.
</p><p>
    From 2001 to 2009, I ran a website called "IF-Review" to try to encourage
    reviews of these longer games. I offered a (very small, alas) amount of
    money for these reviews  in the hopes that it would offset the effort of
    playing through the games and then writing up an in-depth review of them.
    In exchange, I asked for the right to publish them exclusively for one
    week, and maintain them on a website indefnitely. Other than that, the
    authors of the reviews could do with them as they wished.
</p><p>
    I already had a personal website, so it was easy enough for me to just add
    a subdirectory to publish the reviews in. I hacked together a perl script
    to convert reviews into pages, and generate indicies sorted by date, game,
    author, and reviewer. It wasn't pretty, but it worked well for me, and the
    resulting website published dozens of reviews over the years.
</p><p>
    Fast forward to present day, and now the term for the kind of site I was
    publishing is "static website" - sites without a database back-end or
    business logic to generate the pages. Nowadays, there are many static site
    generation tools available and, while my hacky little perl script worked,
    the more modern tools which generate static sites are far superior and
    allow site maintainers to concentrate on the content rather than the
    underlying infrastructure which generates them. I have decided to use the
    <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> tool, which is easy enough to
    adapt to the review file format I had been using.
</p><p>
    So now, without further blathering, here are the <a
    href="reviews">reviews</a> of the games of the nought-ies. I hope you find
    some enjoyment there.
