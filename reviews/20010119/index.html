<p>It's not saying anything new to talk about the IF community having
mixed feelings about puzzles in games. Some people like, some people
don't, and so on for pages. Games fall in various points on the
puzzleness spectrum: to one extreme you have things like
<em>Photopia</em>; and to the other,
things like <em>Mulldoon</em> and <em>Heroine's Mantle</em>. The thing is,
while nobody would argue that
<em>Photopia</em>'s success can be
explained entirely by its lack of puzzles (and not, you know, by
writing quality) far too many people make the mistake of thinking that
games like <em>Heroine's Mantle</em> are successful entirely because
they have a <em>lot</em> of puzzles. In fact, because these games are, or
appear to be, purely puzzle-centric, there's been a massive lack of
critical attention to anything else about them. This is a
pity, because <em>Heroine's Mantle</em> is a world-class game that is
totally worthy of standing alongside <em>So Far</em> or
<em>Galatea</em> in the category of
games that not only bust open new ground and reveal strange vistas,
they're <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>Andy Phillips is of course no stranger to the IF world; before this
game he had previously come out with <em>Time: All Things Come To An
End</em>, <em>Heist</em> and <em>Enemies</em> (four large games is enough to
make him noteworthy if only for sheer quantity). <em>Heroine's Mantle</em>
carries out almost every trend raised by his previous games (except,
thankfully, the grammatical errors, which are toned down considerably)
and molds them together into a game that, for the first time for
Phillips, feels complete and well-structured, and carries its story
with confidence.</p>
<p>Here is what happens in the first twenty points or so of <em>Heroine's
Mantle</em>: you are saved from drowning by a superheroine, you grow
up, you sneak into an office building, you attend a party, you find
out the world is threatened by a master criminal, you have an
encounter with a female assassin, you force your way to the penthouse,
you re-encounter the assassin in the middle of one of her nefarious
schemes, you battle some elite bodyguards, you hack a computer, you
ransack an office. Point-wise, this has all happened in just the first
five percent of the game. Later in the game, you battle various
super-villains (including a space-pirate), fight untold number of
robots and secret cultists, save the city from being poisoned, save
the mayor from being assassinated, and this is <em>all in the same
game</em>. Nobody else has done this or, really, anything close.</p>
<p>To make this massive storyline go requires the player to make mental
leap after mental leap, often blindly, hoping the game will be there
when you land. There are machines that have to be fiddled with for no
other reason than that they're there, capabilities of your ship that
have to be guessed at because they're not fully explained anywhere,
even actions that have to be taken for no apparent reason other than
that, in retrospect, they look good. And people <em>hate</em> this.</p>
<p>I obviously can't tell people not to hate that in a game, but I can
say that you should be understanding this as a baseline axiom, not as
a flaw. Meyer Schapiro has this thing about the importance of a
the frame in doing criticism of a painting: it tells you where to
stop looking (and, thus, where to start).
<em>Galatea</em> is set in a single
room, with a single NPC, with no takeable items. This is not a failure
of the game or a problem with the design. It's the frame of the painting
that tells you &quot;this is what I'm interested in; this is what to focus
on&quot;. All IF has restrictions: from the parser, from the world model,
from our inability to code NPCs that can hold &quot;real&quot; conversation. And
the best games take these restrictions and deal with them, whether
it's <em>Galatea</em>
with the tiny world that focuses you on the single NPC,
<em>Spider &amp; Web</em> with the restricted conversation options that
lead to a tense and weighty dialogue, or <em>Heroine's Mantle</em> with
the forced actions and crazy puzzles that let Phillips create a huge
and glorious storyline.</p>
<p>I should perhaps say a few more words about the superhero genre
that the game belongs to. Up till now, there was a distinct lack of
superhero games in IF. Some good ones have been written: <em>Hero,
Inc</em> and the two <em>Frenetic Five</em> games, for instance, but the
most successful have all been comedies. Some part of the superhero
concept is indeed comedic, but mostly it isn't, and we've been waiting
for a game that could capture the whole spirit of the superhero genre.
<em>Heroine's Mantle</em> succeeds. It has humorous, even silly,
bits: wacky villains with strange motivations, ridiculous traps, and goofy
innocent citizens who talk to and/or hinder you. But it also captures
the larger-than-life, super-good against super-evil,
fate-of-the-world-depends-on-this feeling that is so necessary for
realizing the promise of the genre.</p>
<p>Most games have failed because
they're too timid; Phillips dares to go farther and drags the player
along with him, willingly or not. Even the puzzles add to the feeling
of the titanic struggle -- there I am, 2am, grappling with the game, a
few cryptic hints, two megabytes of txd output, and <em>I'm still
stuck</em>. Meanwhile, the PC is engaged in a duel to the death with
the space pirate on the bridge of the submarine while trying to figure
out how the hell she can also divert the torpedoes from an ocean liner
full of innocent lives. You want &quot;complicity&quot;? It's all here.</p>
<p>For certain sorts of games, the best reaction you can have as a player
is &quot;I want to do something like that!&quot; <em>Heroine's Mantle</em> is
doing so many new and crazy things in so many areas that there are
dozens of possibilities that fly out in all directions. And what I'd
most like to see is for lots and lots of players to grab a walkthrough
or txd (or nothing at all besides the .z8, depending on how much
patience they have), play this, and then go out and write some games
of their own.</p>
