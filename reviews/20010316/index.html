<p><em>Here Be Spoilers</em>, naturally. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>Stephen Granade's <em>Losing Your Grip</em> is (or, rather, 'was': registration is
no longer possible, and there is a free version forthcoming) one of the few 
shareware games in the IF world. And like most shareware IF, it was well worth
its price.</p>
<p><em>LYG</em> is a <em>huge</em> game. It is divided into five fits and two 
interludes, some larger, some smaller, but it'll take you quite a while to get 
through the game.</p>
<p>Then you read a hint request on one of the Interactive Fiction-related 
newsgroups, and you realize you can't remember that happening in the game you
played. Surely this person got the game wrong?</p>
<p>They didn't. Stephen sneakily made the game even larger -- and, thus, a lot more
replayable than it already is -- by sending you to one of two different versions
of a fit depending on small choices made in the fit before that.</p>
<p>And he doesn't do this once -- he does it twice. It's pretty daring to include
multiple paths in a story given the danger nobody ever discovers them, but
he pulls it off beautifully. And the game is good enough you'll want to go back
and try the alternative fits as well.</p>
<p>Apart from being huge and sneaky, <em>LYG</em> is also a difficult game, 
especially in the later fits. The game begins harmless enough:</p>
<div class="gametext rounded">
        <p><b>Rain and mud.</b></p>
<p>Those are your first solid memories.  Rain pouring down on your head, filling 
your eyes.  Mud beneath your feet, filling your shoes.  Other details slowly 
filter in.  The trees surrounding you.  The leaden skies above.  The chill wind 
cutting through your clothes with ease.</p>
<p>Shelter would be a good beginning.</p>
</div>
<p>Come to think of it, this isn't harmless at all. Nevermind.</p>
<p>Like in the commercially released (and horribly under-rated) graphic adventure 
game <em>Sanitarium</em>, <em>Losing Your Grip</em> is a bizarre journey through 
the depths of the subconscious that would make Freud go green with envy. This
is also where the similarities end -- almost. <em>LYG</em>'s backstory is 
partially given away in the feelies you receive upon registration, and the game
makes a lot more sense with them.</p>
<p>After an encounter with the now famous buried human head <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
you do manage to find shelter. And this is where things start to get really
strange.</p>
<p>There is an abandoned building full of stopped clocks; a person named Frankie, 
cataloguing spheres; objects that appear out of nowhere, containing -- what?
Memories? Threats?</p>
<p>Your explorations soon yield a companion, a name-able dog who accompanies you on 
your further travels as well as being vital in solving puzzles. In fact, the 
first puzzle involving him (no gender is given, but I think of the dog as male) 
is not clued at all, as far as I can tell, and will probably involve having to 
restart for most players when they realize they can not carry objects across 
fits. This is, however, the only puzzle I really found &quot;unfair&quot; or &quot;arbitrary&quot; 
(in a sense) -- I may have needed to use hints continuously in the later fits 
(especially the Mathematical and the Abstract), but those puzzles were well 
enough clued to be solvable without resorting to the excellent in-game hints, 
given enough time.</p>
<p>(Did I mention hints are only available when you register? Don't worry, the
forthcoming free version will probably provide them also.)</p>
<p>Very many things in this game are allegorical, and most do not reveal their
deeper meaning until a later Fit, if at all. Stephen deliberately does not 
explain his own designs; he fears that players will see his words as 
authoritative (which makes sense, him being the author and all) when he is much
more interested in what players think. &quot;Yes, it's deliberate,&quot; as Zarf would 
say.</p>
<p>Later fits take the player, Terry, into a hospital or his old school 
(depending), a fairy-tale world, an abstract or mathematical puzzle-fest
(again, depending) and finally to confrontation with his nemesis -- and 
himself.</p>
<p>The game is extremely well-written, the scenery pulling you right in. It 
understands a surprising number of commands. My favourite: after a doctor
had told me to &quot;Administer CPR. Now,&quot; I typed, without really thinking as the
situation was urgent, <code>ADMINISTER CPR</code>, and lo! it worked. Excellent.</p>
<p>The NPCs in the game respond to what they need to be able to respond to, and
not much more. That's perfectly fine with me; I've never been a friend of 
talking to NPCs just to try and break mimesis. The only thing seeming a bit odd
is dialogue along the lines of:</p>
<div class="gametext rounded">
        <p>&gt;ASK FRANKIE ABOUT SPHERE</p>
<p>Frankie asks, "Which sphere do you mean, the pile of spheres, or the light 
sphere?"</p>
<p>&gt;THE PILE OF SPHERES</p>
<p>(etc.)</p>
</div>
<p>This response feels (and is, of course) artificial. Again, I don't care much;
gameplay is much more important, and this is where the game delivers. And 
delivers. And delivers. After I'd beaten the game the first time, I tried all
the possible alternative endings, which add so much more to the game. Then I
went back and replayed it for the other two fits right away. When I replayed
part of it for this review, I still liked it as much as the first time round.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is what counts in a game.</p>
<p><em>(Note: If you want to know more about Losing Your Grip than you can possibly
imagine you want to, there was an interview on 
<a href="http://ifmud.port4000.com/">ifMud</a> with Stephen, the transcript 
of which you can find <a href="http://www-bioc.rice.edu/%7Elpsmith/IF/bookclub/grip/interview.html">here</a>)</em></p>
<p>For those not in the know, Stephen implemented <code>KICK HEAD</code> as a verb.
Naturally, instead of trying to help the head, everyone kicked it instead. 
<em>[Ed. Note: This is untrue.  There are people who did try to help the head
first, and only tried to kick it after running out of other verbs to try.]</em>
Moreover, this one thing is what the game became (in)famous for, though there
is so much more. Can't have it all.</p>
