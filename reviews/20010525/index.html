<p>Disclaimer: In the review which follows, I've tried to avoid spoiling
anything which you can't find out for yourself within the first two or three
moves. However, it is my belief that <em>FailSafe</em> is best experienced with no
prior knowledge at all. My recommendation is this: it's an excellent game,
so go and play it now, without reading the rest of this review. Of course,
some people might argue that that defeats the point of a review, to which
I'm inclined to agree. So, trust me and play it now, or read the review
first, it's your choice.</p>

"...hello? Hello? Can... me? .. Anyone! Hel.... Need.. hello?"
</div>
<p>Suddenly, a voice is pleading for help. This is the first hint we have of
<em>FailSafe</em>'s subject matter: the title screen, and even the author's original
announcement of the game, remain carefully silent regarding anything more
than the author and betatesters. Then abruptly we are dropped into a broken,
poorly-transmitted radio conversation with an unknown NPC and left to fend
for ourselves.</p>
<p>This conversation, as it turns out, comprises the entire game. During the
brief introduction, we discover that the voice on the other end is the sole
survivor of some terrible disaster, and is now trapped on board a crippled
spaceship falling towards the moon. The interaction in these first few
exchanges feels very natural (except for one minor programming issue), such
that it's actually slightly disconcerting to realise that the conversation
has turned into the game without you noticing.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can order the unseen survivor around the wreck of the
spacecraft very much like playing a conventional IF game. The style of the
descriptions in the first person is reminiscent of <em>LASH</em>, and, to an extent,
older, more conventional first-person games, but <em>FailSafe</em> is much more
adventurous as regards conversation between the player and the protagonist.
At points, the unseen NPC will ask questions, such as &quot;shall I read the
display to you?&quot; — personally, I felt that this did a lot to make the
dialogue seem more realistic and less like a conventional IF game (and,
thankfully, such questions can be ignored entirely if you so desire). There
are points, however, where the voice will come back with the same, sometimes
quite lengthy, chunk of text in response to repeated actions, or even
attempt obviously dangerous actions again in response to your command, with
the same response. However, I found myself succumbing to an effect I've
noticed before (something I seem to recall Emily Short saying she hoped
players would do when playing <em>Galatea</em>): namely, once it became obvious that
repeating actions gave rise to mimesis-breaking responses, I started
avoiding doing it, because by this point, I was getting absorbed in the
game. Maybe this was partly due to the air of mystery that accompanied the
announcement but, as the protagonist explores the wreckage of the ship,
there are subtle clues that something is not quite right.</p>
<p>In addition to talking the survivor through trying to save what's left of
the ship and/or escaping from it, there's a secondary dialogue of a sort
going on with some kind of computer program in response to the incoming
information. As well as giving background information, this helps us see the
PC's role a little more clearly, and the incoming battle reports give a
sense of the wider background.</p>
<p><em>FailSafe</em> is not a difficult game — there aren't really any puzzles to speak
of in the traditional sense, meaning that it's not hard to reach the end of
the game with a little patience. However, there's the ongoing puzzle-like
element of trying to piece together a coherent vision of the environment
from the fractured descriptions given by the NPC. It's not so easy to work
out exactly what is where within the rooms of the ship, although this
problem seems more forgivable in light of <em>FailSafe</em>'s context than it does in
other, more traditional games. One thing it's a shame to see missing is that
the protagonist never varies his or her phrasing when redescribing rooms,
which would be useful to the player as well as strengthening mimesis.</p>
<p>One complaint a lot of people had about this game was the fact that,
presumably in an attempt to increase immersion, almost all the standard meta
verbs are disabled; in particular, it's impossible to save and restore. The
relative shortness goes some way towards alleviating this, but there are
multiple possible outcomes, and investigating all of them would be tedious
on an interpreter which doesn't allow you to save your commands and feed
them back in. Additionally, some commands, notably movement, can't be
shortened as much as usual, but there's not a great amount of moving around
involved here in any case, so it seemed to me as though this particular
change served mainly to reinforce the fact that the player is giving orders
to another than mentally ordering herself around, by forcing the command to
be phrased as such (<code>GO UP</code>). However, I can well imagine others disagreeing
on this score.  Happily, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code> and <code>Z</code> still work with their usual
meanings.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of the illusion of talking to a person rather than a
parser, but I found myself spelling out commands in longhand much more
frequently anyway: <code>LOOK AT THE CONSOLE</code> rather than <code>X CONSOLE</code> and similar
(although I've noticed myself doing that anyway in the past, often when I
suddenly get the feeling that an invisible presence is watching me type.
Maybe I'm paranoid, but I digress).</p>
<p><em>FailSafe</em> is not a conventional work of IF, although I'd hesitate to label it
as 'experimental'. It's not an experiment — the departures it makes from
the 'standard' model of IF are all carefully chosen for their effect in
presenting the story, such that it is the story and the world behind it,
rather than any kind of 'gimmick', which dominate at least my memories of
the game. I'm hoping it's also an example for authors of how the effort
involved in doing something differently to the way most IF authoring systems
expect is really worth doing if that's how you think the story is best told.</p>
