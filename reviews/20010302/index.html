<p>Spoilers: There are parts of this review that may spoil some parts of the game
for some people people. These parts are triple-rot13 encoded for your
protection.</p>
<p>If a game has a property defined by (quality of game) / (time it took to make),
then Pytho's Mask has just beaten Shade's record. It's a bit rough around the
edges, but it's much better than what you'd expect from a game that took only
one week to write, even from the master that is Emily Short. (Of course, I loved
her SpeedIF entry, as well.)</p>
<p>The plot is what we've come to expect from Emily. Take something that's embedded
in the background of our worldview, add a few twists, stir in a unique way of
looking at it, and let settle into IF form. Serves everyone. (Ok, the Rats of
NIMH ref in her SpeedIF entry is not quite as universal as Greek myth and
Platonism, but I still loved it.) In a world reminiscent of the Romantic
universe-picture, the earth and heavenly bodies influence events at court. The
Comet, which comes only once a century, shatters the balance, both in heaven and
on earth. This is the time when chaos can reign and those with a mind for dirty
politics can exert their will. (Reading Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture
has really paid off.)</p>
<p>The king has not been doing so well physically, and your Order (of which little
is shown save that it is a force for order and justice) wishes that he remain
capable of his office. The PC remains somewhat mysterious, though I believe that
most of this is due either to the author's constrained schedule or my inability
to puzzle out some of the more badly coded parts. (Which are better than average
IF, even so.) Also mysterious, though with a greater reason, is the man who got
you an invitation to court on the Night of the Comet. He's a Zorro-like figure
with a black mask. V trg gur srryvat gung gur snpg gung ur vf va snpg gur cevapr
vf fhccbfrq gb or zber boivbhf guna vg vf, gubhtu ntnva guvf znl or whfg zl onq
yhpx. And the fortune-teller provides a very nice confirmation of the mythology
of this world.</p>
<p>Speaking of characters, Emily has created another very nice conversation system.
It mixes the best parts of ASK/TELL and menu-based conversation, though it
doesn't always work quite right. It's been explained in detail in other places,
so I won't go into it here, but it's really very good. I was sometimes left with
the feeling that my character had zoned out for a bit and missed some
conversation, but these few mimesis-shattering bugs are small, and can easily be
fixed in future versions.</p>
<p>Speaking of character and plot, perhaps now is a good time to mention that
Pytho's Mask was a SmoochieComp 2001 game, and as such it has not a little bit
of romance involved. Here Emily's skill with multiple endings especially shines
through. You aren't railroaded into any particular ending or relationship,
though like the rest of the time, sometimes the interactivity seems sparse. This
is, of course, the necessary side effect of a shortened development schedule.</p>
<p>Ok. Those of you who read my Galatea review may be asking, &quot;Does it mean
anything?&quot; to which I respond, &quot;Doesn't everything?&quot; However, since answering
with a question fails to satisfy anyone but Socrates and Jesus, I'll say this.
I'm not going to try to read deep things into this. Avril says that Soteria has
a part to play, and she'll play it the way she's supposed to, come hell or high
water, no matter what she does. This is not the way things actually are -- you
can do many different things, resulting in endings all along a spectrum. Still,
if she just sits back and lets the party unfold, nothing happens. This is mostly
just due to the way Emily implemented this game, i think, but it can still mean
something here. If you want to care. I like to think I do.</p>
<p>I liked it. Will you? That depends. If you, as I do, think Emily is the best
thing since sliced cheese, (zarf and Adam Cadre are bread and salami,
respectively) by all means play this game. If you'd rather wait for a more
finished product, Emily has said that she's planning to fix it up a bit and
release a version 2. Also, for budding IF authors, you should not try to write
your game a week before deadlines. But if you do, this is what you should aspire
to. I really liked this game. That's a small catagory: Emily, zarf, and Adam
star regulary here, and a handful of other authors show up too. Ah, what the
heck. Just go play it.</p>
