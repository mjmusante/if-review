<p><em>So Far</em> is one of those games that everyone is supposed to play. It's the
source of numerous jokes and references in other games; it is the longest (and
some would say the most serious and most angst-ridden) of Zarf's games, which
earns it attention in and of itself. And, written in 1996, it is old enough to
stand in the position of a classic in this brief community. (If the reviewer's
job is to tell people whether to play the game, I'm done now: you should,
absolutely. But you knew that.)</p>
<p>Because of its considerable reputation, I tried repeatedly to play it myself,
and failed the first four or five times. The opening of the game is
involving — almost oppressively so. I felt almost claustrophobic playing it,
so vividly are the crowd and the summer heat evoked, so that it was a relief to
escape from the first of the game's environments. At the same time, I had the
sense that I had left behind some important bit of plot, something that I could
or should be interacting with, and I wasn't sure whether I would ever be
allowed to go back. The subsequent puzzles stumped me, in part because I was
trying to make logical sense of the history of the worlds in which I was
traveling, in part because I am not particularly good at visualizing complex
machinery in the way required to manipulate it properly. One of the times I
gave up, I complained to a friend that this was a game that required to be read
slowly.</p>
<p>I am no opponent of dense prose, and I don't mind spending time reading. But I
have always found that when I am deeply involved in a piece of interactive
fiction, a sense of urgency builds so that I am too impatient to read deeply
and receptively. I want short pieces of prose, not long paragraphs. And I
don't want flowery writing, either, or anything that stands between me and the
most rapid possible comprehension. How am I supposed to know what to do when I
am busy trying to ferret out the significance of lines upon lines of metaphor?
Correspondingly I try for brevity in my own IF writing; I try to layer
description through deep implementation, so that one description leads to
another rather than the first surface description hitting the player with pages
of prose. So I struggled with <em>So Far</em>, because my normal mode of playing IF is
one in which I bash at things in order to understand them. I explore and
summarize first, then tinker with the details to see what they will yield up.</p>
<p>And that's the wrong way to play this game, if one can talk about right and
wrong approaches. This is the kind of game where you not only have to read
each piece carefully and thoughtfully the first time, you also have to stand
permanently apart from what's going on. You're doing things that make no real
logical sense — by the hundred, it seems. Graham Nelson's Player's Bill of
Rights is triumphantly defied by some of the acts of intuitive leaping,
save-and-restore decipherment, and hindsight required to get through the game
properly. Even so I only managed with liberal use of Lucian Smith's
Invisiclues and suggestions from friends on ifMUD. As Duncan Stevens says in
his recent SPAG review of the same game, <em>So Far</em> works thematically, but the
plot doesn't entirely make sense.</p>
<p>So it's involving, as I said, because of the vivid landscapes and the
portentous sense of meaning that pervades everything, but it is perhaps not
immersive in the classic sense. The save-and-restore method of solving
problems is one that quickly teaches you to disregard your PC's life; danger is
diminished thereby. (Adam Cadre's <em>Varicella</em> carries this effect perhaps to
its ultimate extreme, but it is present here as well.) I didn't feel that I
was the player character, exactly. After all, he would have had access to the
background knowledge to explain (and wouldn't that be convenient?) exactly what
was going on between himself and his beloved(?) Aessa, among other things. I
the player could only guess. The experience in that respect was a bit like
reading a work of static fiction in which much of the background is
deliberately withheld. I'm reminded of trying to read <em>The English Patient.</em>
(I didn't like it as much as the movie and stopped after page 2.)</p>
<p>Thus far we have fiendish puzzles, a density of prose and concept that
challenges the average approach to IF, and a certain amount of narrative
distance between player and PC. Something relatively inaccessible, in short.
But what the game gains by being obscure, by demanding intellectual attention
at a high order, is the ability to address itself to abstracts. Interactive
fiction is a medium that principally deals with the concrete: objects that you
can pick up and move around in standardized ways, without resorting to too
complex or elusive a vocabulary. Various people have proposed, for instance,
NPC interaction systems that would make use of complicated verbs such as
PROVOKE, APOLOGIZE, etc., but I have yet to see such a system that worked
particularly well, despite having tried to devise one myself. Likewise
important choices of a personal nature — not choices about how to fend off the
alligator who is about to bite off your leg if you don't feed him the ham, but
choices about ethics or emotion — have always to be cast in terms of physical
actions. Jigsaw, Spider and Web, and Tapestry all come to mind as having
moments where the player's moral choice is encapsulated in a physical action,
the significance of which has been carefully developed and spelled out in
advance. What <em>So Far</em> achieves that distinguishes itself even from these (which
are themselves moments of high artistry in the genre) is not teaching the
player how to regard a single action as representative of moral choice, but
presenting the whole world in such a way that it seems redolent of such
choices, tying the physical environment intimately to the emotional one in ways
that are sometimes visible only in retrospect.</p>
<p>To say that it relies on symbolic vocabulary is to understate the issue.
Jigsaw, for instance, relies on symbolic vocabulary as well, especially in the
endgame. But Nelson's symbols are isolated and recognizable, and stand out
from the landscape in their symbolic significance like a girl in a red dress.
'Note this!' they say. And they are organized with a tidy symmetry, perfect
and mathematical, so that the meaning of anything unexplained may be worked out
by its relations to other symbols and the oppositions between them. Plotkin's
symbolism is merged wholly with the landscape; it <em>is</em> the landscape. The
pieces are polyvalent and connotative, any given thing suggesting an array of
connections and meanings, not denoting a single concept in its purity.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether any subsequent work has approached it in this 
regard. I am not sure that anyone has tried.</p>
