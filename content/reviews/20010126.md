Despite the fact that it was first released in the IF Art Show, not in a normal
IF competition, _Galatea_ has a plot or, rather, a couple dozen plots. Like
its sister work, _Metamorphoses_, _Galatea_ is an example of Multilinear IF, and a
very good one at that. Both _Galatea_ and _Metamorphoses_ are intended, if I
understand the author correctly, to demonstrate ideal simulationist design, but
they are much more than demos.

_Galatea_ is the first work since _So Far_ and _Photopia_ to take me prisoner, to
capture my heart. _So Far_ did it with its marvelous worlds and sheer mystery,
_Photopia_ did it when the pieces finally tumbled together, and _Galatea_ does it,
well, with Galatea. I should explain.

This work begins with you, an art critic, standing in a forgotten corner of an
exhibition with Galatea. She is a statue, standing on a pedestal. She greets
you and, from there on, the plot is different for everyone. Emily Short has
written forty-odd endings, each of which can be reached in myriads of ways.

Over the course of one possible conversation, it is revealed that the
exhibition is a place where makers of artificial intelligences will show their
skill and, one possible ending (which I found only using txd, when I was
looking for something else) shows Galatea as one of the computerized creations.
I never found how to get it in the game. I didn't want to -- this type of
ending I did not seek out. Fortunately, there are many endings that are not like
that. I could choose. And because I could, I chose the paths that made Galatea
a person, if not a human. I chose the paths that showed her her humanity, her
freedom.

Why? Because I could. Because it was the decent thing to do. Because, absurd to
even think it, I had fallen in love with her. By that time, I had forgotten
the existence of Emily Short, of my computer, of the game. Absurd, I say. And
so it is. I was worse than Gatsby! Understandable, perhaps. The point of this
work is to show the power of realistic NPCs in realistic games. That, it does.

So why did the author write so many possible endings? Why did she open the door
for a na&iuml;ve teenager to anthropomorphize? Why did she give some responsibility
for writing the story to the _player_?
Upon reading some essays from the author's site, an answer appears. Ironically
enough, she did it because of me and because of everyone else that plays the game.
The aim is to give the freedom to do anything that is reasonable (reasonable in the game
world, I mean), to give the ability to have the game
respond to the player's wishes. That is, she did it because she could.

When this happens, it means that the player has an active role in the act of
creation. What we make may well be a judge of what we are. I am reminded of the
concept that arose around the time quantum mechanics was first becoming
well-known. It arose from the fact that the observer was an integral part of
the experiment and said, basically, that "wishing makes it so". This also led
to some interesting interpretations of Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat, but I digress. The
author has written one scenario which she calls Eliza, where the PC bares his
soul for Galatea, but the game itself serves as a psychiatrist, forcing us to
see and try to understand some of what we are.

So, what do I make of Galatea? What stories have I decided to form? Good
question. I don't know. There are endings such as the ones with Dionysus that
leave me fearful, but wanting to follow. There are endings that are happy,
endings that are not. I have brought her into mortality, or followed her to
immortality. I remain cautious. I -- again, the absurd, perhaps justifiable
response -- want to help her be.

I can't. She's a quarter-megabyte bit of code in my computer. The only
existence she has is inside my mind and the minds of everyone else who plays
the game. I can't affect what they do with her; She's not real _dammit!_ I
overreact. I anthropomorphize. A good sense of fantasy is healthy, but when you
can't tell the difference anymore, that's insanity. Madness.

That's in the game, too. Madness, given by the gods. Hubris, sometimes
punished, sometimes rewarded. For what is the idea of art, if not an intrusion
on the gods' monopoly on creation?

But let's turn the tables about and become somewhat paranoid for a moment.
I remember a certain ending: Galatea as daemon, or god. I remember that no one
has actually seen Pygmalion, we have only Galatea's word for his existence. I
remember something Emily Short wrote, in a different context that suddenly
seems much too similar: "Greek myth is full of such moments, when a god among mortals,
disguised and mocked, suddenly turns with eyes shining. Terror follows, and
madness." This certainly can explain almost all of the possible endings, if one
has a taste for such an idea. I don't; it's way too frightening. This is the
sort of time that I reassure myself that it's only a game, and maybe half
succeed.

If we continue this sort of mind exercise, we come presently to Platonism and
again to quantum mechanics. If everything we perceive is but a shadow of some
higher plane, and everything that is, is only in the mind, then we can affect
reality directly, as opposed to the sort of everyday changes we make to the
world. Here we drift dangerously into semantics and religion, but it's worth
taking a look at, anyhow.

And so perhaps we have a trinity collaborating on this work: the Author, the
Reader, and the Subject, Galatea. We affect her by what we choose to write and
what we choose to read, but she affects us too, when we see what story we have
written and ponder what it can mean.

In closing, just in case you're still with me, (as opposed to having quit
halfway through to download Galatea) I'd like to say one thing: Play this game.
Then, write your own. Pour your heart and soul into it. Cast it upon the
waters, and you may indeed receive it back a hundredfold.
